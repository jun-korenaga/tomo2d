This package provides an implementation of joint refraction and reflection travel-time tomography presented by Korenaga et al.[J. Geophys. Res., 105, 21591-21614, 2000]. Please read this paper before using this code. At this moment, a user’s guide included in this distribution (readme.pdf) provides only the minimum technical details. If you have found bugs or errors in the user’s guide, please email me at jun.korenaga@yale.edu.

Note that this code was written a while ago (mostly in 1999) and even though I occasionally update it, the code is not completely compatible with the latest C++ standard, so you will likely see many compilation warnings. I hope I can fix those things in the future. 

And the shell script provided in the sample folder is based on GMT4 (the version I like most), so you will need to modify it if you're not using GMT4.
